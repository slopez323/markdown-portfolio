1. In your "fork" of the repository, edit the `README.md` and replace all of the previous content with your own Markdown which should contain:

    * [Sarah's Github profile](https://github.com/slopez323)
    * - Bullet item #1
    * 1. Numbered item #1
    * **Sample BOLD text**
1. Once you've added all of the previous elements, read through this markdown cheatsheet (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add one additional element not previously listed
1. Once you're done with this, adjust the settings of your repoistory to enable GitHub Pages. This should provide you a URL at which your project is hosted.
2. Update the "About" section of your repository so that your project's "website" is the GitHub Pages URL
3. Finally, turn in a link to your repository on Populi
